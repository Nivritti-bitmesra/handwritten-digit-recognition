# Digit-recognition-CNN
# A convolutional neural network approach for handwritten digit recognition 

The dataset used for training our CNN model is the famous MNIST dataset which contains grayscale images of handwritten digits' of size 28 x 28 pixels. The dataset used for this model was downloaded from the link : https://datahack.analyticsvidhya.com/contest/practice-problem-identify-the-digits/
The original source of the dataset : http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/

The dataset has been divided into two parts :
1. Labeled images in train folder
2. Unlabeled images in test folder

For computing accuracy , we divide our labeled images into training data and test data . We keep the unlabeled data as holdout data for checking model accuracy on unseen images.

Some predictions on the holdout data :
